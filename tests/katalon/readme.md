#### What need to do next:
- Logging / Report
  + Currently, there is no way to log test step info as normal
  + Maybe we have to change the way we log test steps
- Debugging
  + Implement an integrated JS debugger into Katalon
  + Currently, the users can use any other IDE that supports debugging JS
- Record to JS script
- Parse JS script back to the Recorder
- WebDriver: 
  + Remote variable?
  + 
- Test Listener:
  + 
- Integration:
- Plugins:
  
- Test Suite
  + Workflow:
    + Start Test Case (Groovy)
    + [Inside test case]
      + Start RPC server
      + Run JS script
      + End test case
    + Export reports...
- Some other things to do:
  + Write declaration (document like) for classes, types... into TS syntax
